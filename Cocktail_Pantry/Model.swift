    The history of this drink's ingredients is far older than the drink itself. The mixture of Rum, Lime and Sugar traces it's history waaaaay back to the 17th Century when the British began importing it back to England from the west indies. It wasn't very long before the seafaring folk doing the actual importing figured out how delicious it was to make punches by adding these things together. Once imported to England though, only the rich could afford these rarified ingredients. I haven't done the research to prove this but I'm pretty sure this mixture of alcohol citrus and sugar did it's part in the creation of Pirates. The sailors risking their lives to import a product they couldn't afford I'm sure pissed them off enough to rebel and take hold of these valuable commodities for themselves.
    
    Fast Forward to 1740 when British Navy Admiral Edward "Old Grog" Vernon ordered that all Rum rations for the men be mixed with Limes (they'd figured out that it was a cure for scurvy by now) and sugar to dilute the potent spirit. At the time England was at war with Spain and now that the British were a little more healthy and a tad more sober than their Spanish counterparts  which  gave them a small advantage. But still the modern day daiquiri wasn't made until...
    
    ...Another war with Spain was underway, this time the Spanish-American War around 1898. The story goes that an American mining engineer stationed in Cuba named Jennings Cox created the drink to help protect his workers from Yellow Fever. There were rumors that Cox created the drink at a dinner party when he ran out of Gin and only had Rum left. Several decades after that another man by the name of P.D. Pagliuchi claimed that he was in fact the creator of the Daiquiri and retold the dinner party story. We'll probably never know the true history but we can all mull it over while we're drinking this fantastic cocktail.

    Ernest Hemingway is something of a legend in the annals of cocktail history. He has written extensively on his travels and the drinks imbibed on those adventures. He is said to have had his first Daiquiri at La Floridita. For those of you who don't know La Floridita is a famous restaurant and cocktail bar in Havana's historic district. It first opened it's doors in 1817 under the name "La PiÃ±a de la Plata" (The Silver Pineapple in Spanish). This bar was one of Hemingways favorite haunts and is said to have had his first Daiquiri there. After trying the Daiquiri for the first time he remarked: "That's good, nut I prefer mine with twice the rum and no sugar." effectively asking for a double rum with a squeeze of lime. Hemingway's nickname at the bar was "Papa" and this drink became known as the "Papa Doble." Over time the drink evolved to include Maraschino and Grapefruit Juice and became known as the La Floridita Daiquiri #3 then later as "Hemingway's Special Daiquiri". Most bartenders nowadays know this drink as the Hemingway Daiquiri, dropping the word  "Special" from the name.

    Like Most Cocktails the origin story of the Manhattan is veiled and uncertain. Nobody really knows exactly when it was created but the most credible puts its creation at New York's Manhattan Club somewhere in the vicinity of 1880. Give or take a couple of years. If that is the case then the 2:1 ratio the cocktail has today was slightly different than the one it had at it's inception. According to the club's history which was chronicled in Henry Watterson's History of the Manhattan Club: A Narrative of the Activities of Half a Century, the cocktail called for equal portions Sweet Vermouth cancan then further estimate that the original recipe was made with Rye Whiskey which was the preferred whiskey of the Northern States at that time.
    Much like everything else, this cocktail changed over time with the 2:1 ratio yielding a much more balanced drink, the orange bitters gave way to angostura to kick up the spice and that all culminated in this video on how to make a proper Manhattan (see what I did there?).
    
    It's a note worth making that although a Bourbon Manhattan is quite popular, the original was done with Rye. And it's not that accurate to say that Rye should be used just to be annoyingly exacting in recreating classic drinks. Rye is a much spicer style of whiskey and balances the flavor of sweet vermouth much better. also Sweet vermouth selection is key, while Carpano Antica is very popular and many bartenders swear by it, unless you're using overproof Rye such as Rittenhouse, this vermouth will overpower the main spirit, killing the cocktail. Carpano is also an old style Italian vermouth in the "vermouth alla viniglia" style which contains too much vanilla and will yield a strange tasting manhattan. If you want to add a few dashes of Orange bitters to make a more historic version go ahead, but make sure that you garnish with a twist of lemon, to knock up the citrus notes.

Then shortly thereafter whenever anyone would order an Americano (Then all the rage) they would ask for it "The Negroni Way"
    The Family was quick to capitalize on the success of the cocktail, founding the Negroni distillery in 1919 in Treviso Italy where they produced a ready made version of the drink.

    The first documented use of the word "cocktail" comes from the May 13th 1806 edition of The Balance And Columbian Repository which printed it's definition like this: " A potent concoction of spirits, bitters, water, and sugar."

    The story of the modern Old Fashioned goes something like this: A guy walk into the Pendennis Club sometime in the mid 1880's and sidles up to the bar. He asks the bartender for a drink in the Old Fashioned way. The Bartender, knowing that this guy doesn't want an improved whiskey cocktail (the drink which emerged in the wake of slings) makes this guy a bittered sling, but where this drink deviates is that he puts it on ice, which by now was available widely, and garnishes with a twist of orange, adding the essential oils of the fruit. The Old fashioned was born!

    The Sazerac cocktail is purported to have been invented in 1850 in New Orleans by a man named Antoine Amedee Peychaud. He was a pharmacist who ran a drugstore from which he would prescribe medicine but would also make toddies and tonics as cure-alls as well as a drink with his famous Peychauds Bitters (adapted from a family recipe) which is still served in Sazeracs and other cocktails to this day. The Original recipe called for Cognac or Brandy which changed to Rye in about 1865 due to a blight on wine grapes.The Phylloxera Aphid was wreaking havoc in France and completely stopped brandy and Cognac production. The cocktail also took a hit when Absinthe was banned in the United States in 1912, but the Sazerac hungry public was more than happy to drink anise flavored liquor in it's place.
    in 2002 the ban was lifted and we can have Absinthe again, and of course we have brandy and cognac available, but the rye version has really established itself. In this video we teach with Rye, but feel fee to either replace with Brandy or split the main spirit with Brandy however you like.

    Before the singular mixed drink (what we now think of as a cocktail) the practice was to drink large format drinks in a punch bowl and share it amongst friends. As time went on this began to change as the pace of life got busier and it people began to look down on sitting around for hours on end to drink a punch bowl and get hammered. People were just too busy for so much day drinking, but that didn't mean they didn't want to drink. They just needed something they could imbibe quickly: enter the one-off punch in the late 1850's. Because people had less time, bartenders began making punch recipes designed to be served to one person in a glass that could be drank quickly. According to David Wondrich the very first of these were the Fix and the Sour. And while these drinks were almost identical in ingredients, each had a different build entirely centered around how quickly you were meant to drink them. Of these two drinks it was the Sour (originally done with Gin) which captured the imagination of the public and found itself expanding into it's own category. So the sour began to get spun out into all sorts of different variations and was in it's day the most requested drink. Although the first sours were done over crushed ice the egg white variation of the drink emerged around 1890's and it was in the decade leading up to the turn of the century that so many popular variations such as the New York Sour, Jersey Sour, Jack Frost Sour and Dizzy Sour emerged. It was as Davind Wonndrich writes: "one of the cardinal points of American Drinking" and it definitely deserves consideration today. Enjoy!
